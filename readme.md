# automat

## Why
This started out as a fork of [Plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop). I realized later that the features or modifications I wanted would cause several breaking changes.

## Changes or features that I wanted
- Uses [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) instead of [colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js)
- Has a debug mode using [node-debuglog](https://github.com/sam-github/node-debuglog)
- Uses [nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) for templating
- Has a few tests

## Install

```
$ npm install --save automat
```


## Usage

```js
const automat = require('automat');

```
